Project: Flight Booker

My implementation of a Flight Booker project

Project focus: building advanced forms with search and nested attributes.

Build a flight booker, where user selects flight based on date, departure and arrival airports, and # of passengers. User enters passenger detail on booking page and receives confirmation.
